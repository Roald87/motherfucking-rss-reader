    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Provide one or more RSS feed URLs as query parameters: <b>?rss=https://example.com/feed.xml&rss=https://another.com/rss/</b>.</p>

    <p><a href="/?rss=https://roaldin.ch/feed.xml&rss=https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds&rss=https://seths.blog/feed">For example.</a></p>

    <p>That's it motherfucker.</p>

    <p>It works on all platforms, browsers and even your grandma's phone.</p>

    <p>Want to synchronize your feeds across your shitty devices? Just copy the url and bookmark it you dumb ass.</p>

    <h2>Where do I register?</h2>
    <p>What? Why? It's just a simple RSS reader. Fuck that.</p>

    <h2>How do I mark feed as read?</h2>
    <p>You click on it. The text turns a lighter shade of gray.</p>
    <p>BAM!</p>
    <p>No annoying bubbles constantly reminding you of how much shit you have to read.</p>

    <h2>Satire?</h2>
    <p>Yes this is satire. Well, a bit. It is still nice to build a webpage that does something. Not that static shit of the motherfuckingwebsiteâ„¢s. </p>
